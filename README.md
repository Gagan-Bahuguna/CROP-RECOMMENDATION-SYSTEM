A vast fraction of the population of India considers agriculture as its primary occupation. The production of crops plays an important role in our country. Bad quality crop production is often due to either excessive use of fertilizer or using not enough fertilizer. The proposed system of IoT and ML is enabled for soil testing using the sensors, is based on measuring and observing soil parameters. This system lowers the probability of soil degradation and helps maintain crop health. Different sensors such as soil temperature, soil moisture, pH, NPK, are used in this system for monitoring temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and soil pH along with NPK nutrients of the soil respectively. The data sensed by these sensors is stored on the microcontroller and analyzed using machine learning algorithms like KNN based on which suggestions for the growth of the suitable crop are made. 

Keywords : Soil nutrient identification, Crop suggestion, Plant pathology, Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium (NPK), Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN).

Abbreviations : Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) , Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium (NPK), Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML).
